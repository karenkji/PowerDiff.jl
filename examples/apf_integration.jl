# Joint APF + PD Workflow: N-1 Screening + Sensitivity Analysis
# =============================================================================

# This example demonstrates using AcceleratedDCPowerFlows (APF) for fast
# contingency screening and PowerDiff (PD) for gradient-based
# economic sensitivity analysis. APF handles the speed-critical forward
# computation; PD provides the differentiable optimization layer.
