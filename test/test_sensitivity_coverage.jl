# Exhaustive API contract test: verifies all valid (operand, parameter) combinations
# return correctly-typed Sensitivity{T} with right dimensions and metadata, and
# invalid combinations throw ArgumentError. Does NOT verify numerical accuracy —
# FD verification tests (test_dc_opf_verification.jl, test_ac_pf_verification.jl,
# etc.) handle that.
