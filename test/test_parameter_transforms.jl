# Verifies AC PF parameter transforms produce correct sign-flipped
# sensitivities: ∂/∂d = -∂/∂p and ∂/∂qd = -∂/∂q. The sign flip arises
# because increasing demand decreases net injection (p = pg - pd).
# Also confirms DC PF/OPF treat :d as a native parameter (no transform),
# and that introspection lists transform-derived symbols (:d, :qd).
